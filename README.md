# Organizer Project.
### This project was built from the Start by Capgemini program.

> ### 1.0 Starting a Project.

> ### 1.1 Definition of a basic project.
> - The initial proposal was an application for managing projects and the tasks involved in this project.
I made adaptations so that the application was functional for those who wanted to enter goals, appointments or even simple notes.
> - Objective: Give the user the possibility of having an application where he could make a daily checklist of his day, or write down goals he would like to accomplish or even just write a message to remind him, becoming a more versatile application.

> ### 1.1.1 Requiriments project.
>  ##### Entities:
> - Category
> - Task
> ##### Requiriments
> - Allow creation of a category.
> - Enable category changes..
> - Enable category exclusion.

> - Allow to create the task.
> - Enable to change the task.
> - Enable to delete the task.

> ### 1.1.2 Business Rules.
> - The application will not have a login system..
> - There will be no concept of a user.
> - Each task must belong to a category.

> ### 1.1.3 Technologies used.
> - Java
> - MySql

> ### 2.0 Application Interface
> - The first screen will be the initial screen as soon as you open the application, containing its categories and their respective tasks, being able to perform some interactions with your tasks. <br />

> ### 2.2
> - And finally, the last window can only be opened after creating a category, since every task must belong to a category, as explained earlier. In this new window you will find 4 fields to be filled in or not (some are mandatory). <br />
